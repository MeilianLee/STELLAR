## Abstract

Flood-managed aquifer recharge (Flood-MAR) is a promising solution for mitigating flood and drought risks 
while enhancing groundwater supply. The key challenge lies in optimizing water and land allocation for recharge 
across space and time. Traditional planning approaches rely on static policies and perfect future predictions, 
making them inadequate for dynamic and uncertain environments. Here, we propose a spatially explicit planning 
framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for adaptive agriculture and water management. Our approach 
employs proximal policy optimization to train networks that generate pixel-level decisions and evaluate policy 
performance. Through a case study in California's San Joaquin Valley, we demonstrate Flood-MAR's potential for 
risk mitigation and DRL's effectiveness in developing adaptive management strategies.

## Motivation

### Growing Pressures on Agricultural Landscapes
Agricultural landscapes are facing mounting pressures from increasing conflicts of water and land use. 
Meanwhile, unsustainable water and land use practices have led to serious environmental concerns, 
including groundwater depletion and biodiversity loss. Climate change further exacerbates these challenges 
by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency and severity of extreme events like floods and droughts.

### Need for Sustainable Transition
These agricultural landscapes urgently need to transition toward sustainable practices that:<br />
• Deliver multiple socio-economic and environmental benefits<br />
• Minimize trade-offs in water and land use under deep uncertainty<br />
• Adapt water and land use management to keep pace with the changing climate

### Role of Managed Aquifer Recharge
Water storage infrastructure is a key adaptation option for sustaining agricultural landscapes under uncertainty. 
However, conventional storage solutions no longer suffice to meet future water storage demands. 
Given the vast storage capacities of groundwater aquifers, managed aquifer recharge (MAR) offers a largely untapped 
opportunity to augment groundwater supply while supporting agriculture development and ecosystem health.

{/*
### Limitations of Traditional Approaches
Traditional spatial planning approaches face several key limitations:<br />
• Assume perfect system information<br />
• Rely on static policies<br />
• Neglect the dynamics and uncertainties inherent in the system<br />
• Lead to high risks of suboptimal performance and unexpected failures
*/}

### Opportunities of AI
Traditional planning approaches often assume perfect system information and rely on static policies, which cannot 
well adapt to dynamic and uncertain environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically Deep 
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), offer a scalable solution by learning optimal strategies through iterative agent-environment 
interactions, effectively handling large state and action spaces.

{/*
### Call for Innovation
There is an urgent need for adaptive and resilient planning frameworks that can effectively account for dynamic interactions between 
water resource management and agricultural sustainability under varying climatic conditions.

## STELLAR Model
### Overall Framework

We present **STELLAR** (**S**patial-**T**emporal **L**earning for **LA**ndscape **R**epurposing), a novel spatial-temporal adaptive planning 
framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the joint management of agricultural landscapes 
and groundwater resources, with particular emphasis on Flood-Managed Aquifer Recharge (Flood-MAR). The optimization 
problem is formulated as a sequential Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved using an actor-critic-based DRL 
architecture.

STELLAR consists of the following essential components:<br />
• **Agent**: The central decision-maker responsible for regional land-use planning<br />
• **Environment**: The coupled agricultural-water systems that model dynamic interactions between water demand and supply above and below the ground<br />
• **Actor Network**: Generates pixel-level probabilistic land-use decisions based on current system states<br />
• **Critic Network**: Evaluates policy performance through value estimation<br />
• **Policy Optimization**: Utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to ensure stable learning within trust regions

  </Figure>

This integrated, AI-driven approach not only minimizes the trade-offs on water and land use within the water-agriculture nexus, 
but also provides a robust tool for policymakers and stakeholders to make decisions systematically in the face of increasing climatic 
uncertainties.

## Figures

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <Figure slot="left" caption="Take a look at this YouTube video.">
    <YouTubeVideo videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
  </Figure>
  <Figure slot="right" caption="Now look at this Gaussian Splat, rendered with a React component.">

## Heading levels

Use headings to divide your content into sections.

### Heading 3

Go down a level to heading 3...

#### Heading 4

...and down again to heading 4.

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />

## Tables

You can add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |
